Sure the buttons are different and the OS has a different look but fundamentally they are the same.",

Lovely new watch faces to choose from; sync photos and listen to music directly from the watch; connects to my BT earpiece seamlessly. Tracks all my sport events effortlessly. The rotating basel is just beautiful. I don't regret this buy in any way. Thumbs up Samsung!",
